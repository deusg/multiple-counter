# Count by 2s, 3s, or Multiples of Any Number
Description:

This Python script allows users to print numbers from 0 in the multiples of the number the user selects. For example, if the user wants to count by 7s, then print 0, 7, 14, 21, 28 and so on until the user select quit.

## Functionality:

1. The program starts by prompting the user to enter a number they want to count by.
2. It initializes a counter variable and starts counting from 0 in multiples of the user-specified value.
3. After printing each number, the program asks the user whether they want to continue counting.
4. If the user decides to continue, the program increments the counter and continues counting.
5. If the user chooses to quit, the program terminates.

## Purpose:

This script is useful for scenarios where users need to generate sequences of numbers in multiples of a specific value. It provides a simple and interactive way for users to generate such sequences, allowing them to specify the starting value and the interval between consecutive numbers.

## Credits
This project was inspired by the book "Creative Coding in Python" (Chapter 3, Page 80).
